# Issue Triage Guidelines

1. **Labeling and Categorisation**: Label and categorise issues accurately. Use predefined labels to classify issues based on their nature, such as bug, enhancement, documentation, or feature request. Additionally, consider adding labels for priority levels, complexity, or difficulty to help prioritise tasks.

2. **Reproducibility and Details**: Ask contributors to provide detailed steps to reproduce the issue. Encourage them to include specific error messages, screenshots, or any other relevant information that can aid in understanding and addressing the problem. Ensure that they provide information about the environment in which the issue occurred.

3. **Duplicate Check**: Before triaging an issue, encourage contributors to search existing issues to avoid duplicates. Guide them on how to perform effective searches and provide suggestions on using filters or keywords to narrow down results. If a similar issue already exists, kindly redirect the contributor to the existing discussion.

4. **Clarity and Scope**: Encourage contributors to provide clear and concise descriptions of the issue, avoiding ambiguity or vague language. Ask them to focus on a single problem or feature request per issue to ensure a well-defined scope. If an issue is too broad or unclear, kindly request additional clarification.

5. **Priority and Severity**: Help contributors assess the priority and severity of their reported issues. Provide guidelines or a matrix for categorising issues based on their impact, urgency, or user impact. This helps establish a consistent approach to prioritising tasks and addressing critical issues promptly.

6. **Assigning and Triaging Ownership**: Assign issues to the appropriate maintainers or team members based on their expertise or workload. Establish guidelines for maintainers to review and take ownership of issues promptly. Encourage open communication to avoid duplication of efforts and ensure timely resolutions.

7. **Requesting Additional Information**: If an issue is missing critical details or is not reproducible, kindly ask contributors for more information. Provide a clear template or list of specific details that would help in troubleshooting or understanding the issue better. Offer guidance on how to provide logs, relevant code snippets, or sample data if applicable.

8. **Closing Inactive or Irrelevant Issues**: Regularly review and close inactive or irrelevant issues. Establish a time frame for inactivity after which an issue may be closed. Clearly communicate the criteria for closing an issue, such as lack of response from the reporter or if the reported problem is no longer relevant due to changes in the project.

9. **Community Interaction**: Encourage maintainers and contributors to actively engage with issue discussions. Promptly respond to questions, provide clarifications, and guide contributors through the triage process. Foster a supportive and inclusive environment that encourages collaboration and participation.

10. **Triage Meetings or Sessions**: Consider organising regular triage meetings or sessions where maintainers can collectively review and prioritise incoming issues. This allows for collaborative decision-making and ensures a shared understanding of issue status and priorities.
