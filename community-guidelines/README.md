# Community Guidelines

1. **Be respectful and inclusive**: Treat all contributors with respect, kindness, and professionalism. Avoid any form of harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or any other characteristic.

2. **Contribute to the project's goals**: Ensure that your contributions align with the organisation's vision, goals, and objectives. Familiarise yourself with the project's documentation, guidelines, and roadmap to understand how you can make meaningful contributions.

3. **Communicate effectively**: Use clear and concise language when discussing ideas, reporting issues, or providing feedback. Be open to different viewpoints and engage in constructive discussions. Avoid excessive use of jargon or technical terms that might hinder understanding.

4. **Submit high-quality work**: Prioritize quality in your contributions. Before submitting a pull request, ensure that your code is well-documented, follows the organisation's coding standards and style guidelines, and passes all relevant tests. Provide thorough explanations of your changes to facilitate the review process.

5. **Collaborate and seek feedback**: Collaboration is key to the success of open-source projects. Engage with other contributors, offer help when needed, and be open to receiving feedback on your work. Actively participate in discussions, code reviews, and issue tracking to improve the project as a whole.

6. **Respect intellectual property**: Only contribute work that you have the necessary rights and permissions to share. If you use external resources, such as code snippets, libraries, or images, ensure that they are appropriately licensed and credited. Plagiarism or unauthorized use of others' work is strictly prohibited.

7. **Report issues and security vulnerabilities**: If you encounter a bug, vulnerability, or any other issue, report it promptly through the organisation's designated channels. Provide sufficient details, steps to reproduce, and any relevant code or error messages to assist in the resolution process. If you discover a security vulnerability, follow responsible disclosure practices.

8. **Be patient and understanding**: Remember that contributors come from diverse backgrounds and skill levels. Be patient and understanding when assisting others or receiving assistance. Encourage a supportive and inclusive atmosphere where everyone feels comfortable asking questions and seeking help.

9. **Maintain confidentiality and privacy**: Respect the privacy and confidentiality of other contributors and users. Refrain from sharing personal or sensitive information without appropriate consent. Avoid discussing confidential or proprietary information in public channels.
